# Open software design

> Open-source software has made it easier for software developers to study and learn programming by looking at real-world working software. But what about software design? Building architects (not software) study thousands of buildings in their training and career. Software developers, in contrast, only study a handful of other large software designs. This means we repeat mistakes that we would have been able to avoid, should we be able to learn from others.

#### Perspectives

**Cycles**

> History only rhymes, and unlike productivity software, SaaS is not a single horizontal market. But there are some big clusters that seem ripe for consolidation, as well as across verticals. **ERP** in fact was an early example of functional consolidation, one that started in manufacturing and spread to other industries. The question for SaaS Universe™ inhabitants is are you a **consolidator or the consolidated?** -- https://www.platformonomics.com/2021/05/saas-sprawl-and-the-potential-for-market-consolidation/

[Is the modern analytics stack unbundling, or consolidating?](https://sisudata.com/blog/modern-analytics-stack)

**API's**

> "Over the past decade we have seen nearly every industry unlock innovation at scale through a single platform API that abstracts away the historical complexities inherent to that industry. **Twilio** for communications, **Stripe** for payments, **Plaid** for financial records, **Segment** for customer records, and now Mapped for IoT." -- https://blog.mapped.com/ 

**"Open"**

> “Open standards are the best way to make sure that everybody in the industry is involved in setting the direction of technology in our industry.” --https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/09/why-major-fintech-players-are-already-embracing-open-api-standards-vb-live/

> Open protocols backed by proprietary implementations is the future of managed services. -- https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1428411566307766272

> Circa 2008 on Open Source vs Open Standards [1] & lack of portability between SaaS [2]
> Which one is more important open source or open standards? According to Opera Software's CEO Jon S. von Tetzchner it's open standards. A lot of people seem to agree:
> "open standards ARE more important than the licensing of an individual piece of software. Who cares what license the software someone uses is, as long as its always possible to replace it, and freely compete, which a free and open standard ensures."
> I disagree and I'm starting to feel like a lone voice here, maybe I'm wrong? Well let's go through my reasoning. I happen to agree with Bob Suter that "the easy availability of software can accelerate the adoption of a standard" and that adoption makes something a standard or not. For me, the fastest way of achieving such adoption is through providing an operational means of implementing an open standard - which means open source. So in my view, if you want portability you will need **BOTH open standards AND open source. BOTH are important**.

**Boost**

> Our mission is to create a community-driven suite of extensible building blocks for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) builders. Our goal is to foster an open environment for developing and sharing reusable code that accelerates the ability to deliver and operate multi-tenant SaaS solutions on AWS. -- AWS SaaS Boost, https://aws.amazon.com/partners/saas-boost/ 

> One slide which says it all. Before anyone goes "serverless is the future" ... no, "serverless is the norm" - it's just that so many are yet to realise this. Give it time, another five years or so -- https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1412001525191356418

### Build vs Buy

> Apply appropriate purchasing methods. There is no magic one size fits all. Hence you break into small contracts with components that are similar (in terms of evolution). Don't mix commodity with genesis unless you like massive change control cost overruns. -- https://twitter.com/swardley/status/971029206510563328

> In mapping terms, you want to be winning in the orange (good) areas and extracting yourself from the blue (legacy and new legacy) areas. -- https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1428478888401936395

> And if something is not your core domain, why are you wasting time and money (extensively) customizing software (or SaaS for that matter). It's rare that you win the marketplace because you have the best payroll processes.
> Use generic processes that are supported by COTS/SaaS.-- https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1422967303885389824

### **Enterprise**
> Developing and running transformative applications in the cloud requires innovative technology, infrastructure, and services. It also requires a foundation of trust and stability, so organizations have the confidence to make long-term investments on our platform. -- https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis

## Infrastructure

“computation may someday be organized as a public utility, just as the telephone system is a public utility. We can envisage computer service companies whose subscribers are connected to them [...]. Each subscriber needs to pay only for the capacity that he actually uses, but he has access to all programming languages characteristic of a very large system.” -- https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s02-stoica.pdf

In addition to providing services for developers to reduce time-to-market, they have built specialist services targeted at the major technology trends such as blockchain, 5G, machine learning, artificial intelligence and digital identity. Moreover, they are adding many industry-focused solutions.

**Culture is not a set of beliefs, a set of actions**
 
> Companies & Culture: What You Do Is Who You Are - a16z editor in chief Sonal Chokshi interviews a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz -- author of the book What You Do Is > Who You Are -- on whether companies and people can change; how the very thing that is your strength can also be your weakness; how startups evolve from pirates to > the navy; actions vs words and values; and more.

**Culture is "Code"**

What kind of development organization are you a part of: pathological, bureaucratic, or generative? https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/13/suppl_2/ii22.full.pdf

> I am reading a book that was recommended by Kumar, Anil called "[Accelerate - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339/)".  I am about 100 pages in and finally starting to understand the vision around our "destination" culture and honestly the "different cultures" that exist among our divisions.  
> On pg30 the book describes 3 types of organizational cultures.
> 1. **Pathological** (power oriented) organizations are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat.  People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better.
> 2. **Bureaucratic** (rule-oriented) organizations protect departments.  Those in the department want to maintain their "turf", insist on their own rules, and generally do things by the book - their book.
> 3. **Generative** (performance-oriented) organizations focus on the mission.  How do we accomplish our goal?  Everything is subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to do.
> Moving forward in the book I'm learning about changes that need to be made around testing, version control, automation, CICD, communication, etc...  I am starting to be able to tie ideas that are nicely articulated in the book to statements I've heard in meetings by folks like Kumar, Anil, Raghavendra, Vijay, and Charlton, Paul.  Wow.  This is so cool...  It's like a giant light bulb turned on this week!
> I believe our destination culture is Generative.  I also feel that "we all kinda want it".  So, I'm getting excited about what the future holds...
> I recommend that all Tech managers & Architects get a copy of this book and read through it.

* Non-Functional

> "We start by looking at which **“-ilities”** are most important to architects. A software architect is responsible for the cross-cutting concerns and making sure that individual components of a large system can work together seamlessly to meet overall objectives. In 2021, four areas we feel architects are concerned with are designing for resilience, designing for observability, designing for portability, and designing for sustainability."

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

- **Radar**

A technology radar is an opinionated guide to a set of emerging technologies. The popular format originated at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and has been adopted by dozens of companies including Spotify, Zalando, AOE, Porsche and Intuit. 

The key idea is to place solutions at one of three levels:

**ADOPT** — We feel strongly that the industry should be adopting these items. We use them when appropriate in our projects. 

Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.

**TRIAL** —  Worth pursuing. It’s important to understand how to build up this capability. Enterprises can try this technology on a project that can handle the risk. 

Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.

**ASSESS** — Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect your enterprise. 

Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organization. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.

**HOLD** — Proceed with caution. 

Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.

Going back to a movie clip [**The Matrix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVLexf_dyCM) (prepared for education & learning purposes)
> Neo: This...this isn't real?
> Morpheus: What is real. How do you define real? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today....
